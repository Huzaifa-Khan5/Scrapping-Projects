It’s hard to imagine a better combination. Half Baked® got its name because the cookie dough isn’t baked, but the brownies are—has been a bestselling flavor since we first decided to combine our classic ice cream creations back in 2000. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, with big chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough surrounded by vanilla ice cream, was created back in 1984 at our very first Scoop Shop after we received an anonymous fan’s flavor suggestion. It continues as a flavor phenomenon to this very day. Chocolate Fudge Brownie is a fan-favorite chocolate extravaganza, mixing chocolate ice cream with ridiculously delicious Greyston Bakery brownies. It’s been satisfying chocolate lovers since 1991. We know it can be hard to choose between those two legendary flavors. With Half Baked, you don’t have to! We work with Fairtrade certified producers for all the cocoa, sugar, and vanilla in our recipes. Greyston Bakery, one of the largest social enterprises in the US, provides the scrumptious brownies for this and all of our frozen dessert flavors. All our ice cream is made with non-GMO sourced ingredients and cage-free eggs.

It seems like such a no-brainer today, but in 1984 it was revolutionary. The Cookie Dough you know and love started with a simple suggestion: What if you put chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough into vanilla ice cream? That was the wonderful anonymous idea submitted way back in the early days of our first Burlington, Vermont, USA, Scoop Shop. We used to have a bulletin board where people could suggest new flavors for Jerry and Ben to make—and this idea stood out. The folks at the Scoop Shop immediately went to work mixing up a batch of Cookie Dough. It was an instant hit. Initially, the flavor was only available at the Scoop Shop. When we decided to sell it in tubs, we had to figure out how to get that familiar cookie-dough taste, consistency and texture at ice cream temperatures. We teamed up with Rhino Foods and, over an incredible six-year journey, we perfected the cookie dough found in our tubs today. In 1991, Cookie Dough began appearing in freezer aisles everywhere. It has remained one of our most popular and beloved flavors ever since!

Sounds like a dream. At first, that’s all it was. Long ago, we were making brownie ice cream sandwiches for sale in grocery stores. Sometimes there would be broken pieces in the brownie delivery, and we’d nab them for flavor experiments. What would brownie pieces taste like in chocolate ice cream? Pretty good, as it turns out! That original experimental flavor eventually became the legendary ice cream concoction known as Chocolate Fudge Brownie. Meanwhile, Ben Cohen had met Bernie Glassman, the founder of Greyston Bakery, a Yonkers, New York, USA-based company with a mission to end poverty and give back to the community. Equally important, their brownies were just so darn good—after sampling some, Ben handwrote a note asking for two truckloads of brownie pieces. While we knew Greyston would be the ideal supplier for turning Chocolate Fudge Brownie into a flavor sold by the tub, getting the brownies to cooperate wasn’t easy. After about 25 batches of brownies and six months of work, the flavor finally debuted in 1991, and it’s been a hit ever since. All Ben & Jerry's ice cream pints are made with non-GMO sourced ingredients and cage-free eggs. The cocoa, sugar and vanilla in the Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream pint is Fairtrade certified and kosher ice cream. And all our packaging is responsibly sourced.

It was genius, and Ben immediately began creating the iconic concoction. Cherry Garcia debuted in 1987 and quickly became one of our top three most popular flavors. In fact, the first eight ice cream pints went straight to Mr. Garcia himself and were met with two thumbs up! As for the fan who sent the anonymous postcard?

Ben & Jerry's churned up this euphoric creation in honor of The Late Show funnyman Stephen Colbert. It all started back in the fall of 2006 when Ben & Jerry’s Flavor Gurus began tinkering away with Colbert’s personal take on ice cream perfection. Test batches were so euphoric that word quickly spread about the secret collaboration. The Rumor became reality when Colbert invited Ben and Jerry to join him in announcing the collaboration during an episode of The Colbert Report. The flavor has been a huge hit ever since, but what many people don’t know is that the project is, as Colbert puts it, “saving the world,” too.

It’s delicious, but how did it come to be? Ben had been pondering the lack of a good marshmallow ice cream for years. “Most attempts at marshmallow were wispy. You can see the white streaks, but you can't taste them, you can't feel them, you can't experience the true glorious marshmallowness of it all,” Ben remembers. Well, back in 1995, we suggested to the rock band Phish that we celebrate our shared Vermont, USA, roots by creating a Phish flavor. As the wheel started turning on the collaboration, Ben saw an opportunity to solve the marshmallow conundrum once and for all. Starting with a base of rich chocolate ice cream, he and our flavor gurus started bringing the band test tubs of the evolving concoction. “We ate many test tubs around the table with Phish. We’ve done flavors with other artists and entities, but nobody was more involved in creating the flavor than Phish was,” Jerry says. The band was instrumental, for example, in calling for caramel swirl, an addition that pushed the flavor over the top. We work with Fairtrade certified producers for cocoa, sugar and vanilla.

This flavor takes its brownies seriously. So, nothing would do but to have two: fully baked brownies scattered liberally throughout chocolate and vanilla ice creams, and gooey, unbaked brownie batter at the core. Sure, we’re a little biased about spoons around here; if your ice cream is having such a melt-down that you’re slurping it through a straw, it’d darned well better be in a glass and called a milkshake. We’re definitely all about the spoon here. So, it didn’t take us long to realize that our favorite way to eat brownies was with our favorite utensil, straight out of the mixing bowl. But listen: we’ve got nothing against the folks who are all about the crispy edges on a pan of cooked brownies, or even those who eat their brownies with a fork and knife (even though we think it’s kind of weird). So, we decided to meet in the [Ooey gooey, brownie batter-filled] middle: batter-lovers can sink a spoon into the Core, while fully baked brownie lovers get their fix ‘round the edges. Happy bellies all around. Happy taste buds start with cage-free hens producing delicious eggs and Non-GMO sourced ingredients.

It’s a gimme: there’s always room for s’more. And because this ‘shmallowy-rich, graham-good-‘n-chocolatey concoction is now available as a full-time flavor, there’s even s’more reason to stock up! There are times in life where it’s prudent to share. When you’re splitting a bag of popcorn with your date at the movies, for example. Or when you simply need another living, breathing human being to split the cost of paying rent. But there are other times when you need to carve out a section of life that is MINE, ALL MINE. When you should just go ahead and be selfish. Campfire-roasted s’mores are a perfect example. Sure, you could toast two marshmallows on a stick. You could break that graham cracker in two. But why on earth would you?! Nope. We firmly believe that s’more are a one-person snack. So, we advocate scooping up your dish of Gimme S’more before helping others.

We've kicked our Non-Dairy flavors up a notch with an OAT-standing new recipe. Prepare for this creamy, legendary, OAT of this world concoction. This flavor is our tribute to guitarist Jerry Garcia fans everywhere, and it all started with a piece of fan mail. You see, back in the day, before smartphones and social media, our fans spoke to us via handwritten notes pinned to the bulletin boards at our Scoop Shops. Sometime in 1986, one such fan mailed a postcard to our main office in Burlington, Vermont. Ben & Jerry's meets great guitar solos? We loved the idea, and Ben immediately began creating the iconic concoction. Cherry Garcia debuted in 1987 and quickly became one of our top three most popular flavors. But just as every good musician has to evolve, Ben & Jerry's does, too. So in answer to queries from all of those air-guitar heroes who can’t or choose not to eat dairy, we decided it was time to create this fan favorite into a vegan dessert. It’s made with smooth and creamy OAT milk, which is the perfect blank canvas for the cherries and fudge flakes we pack into this pint. Same euphoria, minus the dairy—and here’s hoping it inspires at least a few soulful guitar riffs. Like all of our flavors, Cherry Garcia non-dairy is a gmo free and uses Fairtrade certified cocoa and vanilla. If that’s not enough, we went one step further to gain 100% vegan and gluten free diet certification. All the flavor is wrapped in responsibly sourced packaging, so you can feel good about what’s in your freezer.,• Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia® Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert, certified vegan and Gluten free pint with cherries & fudge flakes,• Ben & Jerry's Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert and certified vegan pints are made with Non-GMO ingredients.,• Ben & Jerry's Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert and certified vegan pints source Fairtrade Certified bananas, coffee, cocoa, sugar, & vanilla.,• Ben & Jerry's Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert and certified vegan pints are certified Kosher-DE,• Ben & Jerry’s Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert and certified vegan pints use responsibly sourced packaging,• Our famous flavor named for a jam band legend has an OATstanding new recipe.
