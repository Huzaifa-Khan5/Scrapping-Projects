An employee-owned company. Gluten free. High protein TVP. You can see our quality! Textured vegetable protein is a highly nutritious soy product. It is incredibly wealthy in complete protein and contains no fat, so it is an excellent alternative to meat. It is also a good source of dietary fiber, iron, magnesium and phosphorus. Textured vegetable protein is made from defatted soy flour that has been cooked under pressure and then dried. It is very easy to prepare and takes on the flavor of whatever recipe to which it is added, making it an incredibly versatile addition to a wide variety of dishes. Wholesome. Bob's Red Mill products labeled gluten free are batch tested in our quality control laboratory. We use an ELISA gluten assay test to confirm that a product is gluten free. Our product line is diverse and extensive. For information and recipes, visit our website at www.bobsredmill.com. Dear Friends, Since starting this company over thirty years ago, our mission has always been to offer the most diverse array of stone ground, whole grain products. About ten years ago, we noticed that some folks were exclusively buying gluten free grains like brown rice, sorghum and quinoa. Soon after that, we learned all about celiac disease and gluten intolerance and how serious they are to millions of people like you. Over the years we have introduced a variety of measures to ensure purity in our line of gluten free products that have become industry standard. We inspect all farm deliveries, use dedicated gluten free production facilities and employ batch testing in our quality control laboratory. Knowing that we're providing safe and delicious gluten free foods that you and your family can trust makes it all worth the effort. To your good health, Bob Moore.

To cook in a microwave, cover tightly with plastic wrap and cook on high for 5 to 6 minutes; check after 2 minutes and add a little more liquid if needed. You can prepare a double batch of chunks, enough for 2 or 3 recipes, and the cooked Bob's Red Mill TVP will keep in the refrigerator several days. Or freeze some to thaw later in the microwave or in the refrigerator.
