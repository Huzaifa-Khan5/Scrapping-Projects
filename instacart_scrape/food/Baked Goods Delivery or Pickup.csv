That's a tough way to find yourself. Dave Dahl realized he was in the wrong game and knew he had more to offer. His brother, Glenn, saw a change in him and gave Dave a second chance by welcoming him back to the family bakery. Dave set out to make a loaf like no other— the most nutritious, organic whole grain bread—and the result is what he called ""killer"" bread.Dave's Killer Bread is built on the belief that everyone is capable of greatness. What began as one man's journey has turned into so much more. Today, one third of our employees at our Oregon bakery has a criminal background, and we have witnessed first-hand how stable employment sparks personal transformation. Inspired by Dave's love of Blues music, Blues Bread® is rolled in organic blue cornmeal, giving it a crunchy crust and sweet flavor. Our take on white bread is an artisan loaf with five super grains, 10 grams of whole grains, and no artificial anything.","Organic Wheat (organic Wheat Flour, Organic Whole Wheat Flour, Organic Cracked Wheat), Water, Ancient Grains Flour Blend (organic Barley Flour, Organic Rye Flour, Organic Spelt Flour, Organic Millet Flour, Organic Quinoa Flour), Organic Dried Cane Syrup (sugar), Organic Expeller Pressed Canola Oil, Organic Potato Flour, Sea Salt, Yeast, Organic Cultured Whole Wheat, Organic Wheat Gluten.",{},"Contains: wheat.

With heavenly texture and saintly flavor, Good Seed® is the boldest and sweetest of our breads. The story of Dave’s Killer Bread® began at the Portland Farmers Market, when Dave Dahl and his nephew brought some loaves of Dave's bread to sell. For Dave, this marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life. Though he grew up in a family of bakers, his life took a different path. A path that landed him in prison for 15 years. Determined to prove his worth and make a positive impact, Dave worked tirelessly to bake breads that tasted unlike anything else on the market — packed with seeds and grains, made with only the very best organic and Non-GMO Project Verified ingredients. Dave’s Killer Bread® believes everyone is capable of greatness.

Going grain free meant that this third-generation Mexican-American family from South Texas could no longer eat many of their favorite foods, so Veronica began to create grain free dishes her whole family could enjoy. When their Grandma Campos said that Veronica's first creation, a grain free almond flour tortilla, tasted better than her own homemade flour tortillas, the family realized they had something special.

The Siete Story: A few years ago. all seven (siete) members of the Garza family began exercising together and adopted a low inflammation, grain free diet to support Veronica, their sister and daughter, who was diagnosed with multiple autoimmune conditions. Going grain free meant that this third-generation Mexican-American family from South Texas could no longer eat many of their favorite foods, so Veronica began to create grain free dishes her whole family could enjoy. When their Grandma Campos said that Veronica's first creation, a grain free almond flour tortilla, tasted better than her own homemade flour tortillas, the family realized they had something special. With their grandma's stamp of approval, Siete was born. Embarrassing Family Photo The Garza Siete, circa 1990. What is Cassava?

The original. Flourless. Low glycemic. Certified by the Glycemic Research Institute. Washington, D.C. The live grain difference. See back panel for details. As Described in the Holy Scripture Verse: Take also unto the wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt. And put them in one vessel, and make bread of it. Ez. 4:9. We discovered when these six grains and legumes are sprouted and combined, an amazing thing happens. A complete protein is created that closely parallels the protein found in milk and eggs. In fact, the protein quality is so high, that it is 84.3% as efficient as the highest recognized source of protein, containing all 9 essential amino acids. There are 18 amino acids present in this unique bread - from all vegetable sources - naturally balanced in nature. Ezekiel 4:9 Bread, made from freshly sprouted organically grown grains, is naturally flavorful and bursting with nutrients. Rich in protein, vitamins, minerals and natural fiber with no added fat. This is the true essence of food. We add absolutely no salt to this bread. Try it served warm to release its rich nutty flavor. This Biblical Bread is Truly the Staff of Life. The Miracle of the Sprouts. Food for Life breads have - The live grain difference. Different from most breads today, this unique bread is made from freshly sprouted live grains and contains absolutely no flour. We believe in sprouting the grains we use in our breads because sprouting is the best way to release all of the vital nutrients stored in whole grains. To unlock this dormant food energy, maximize nutrition and flavor, we add just the right amount of water to healthy whole organically grown grains which are already bursting with nutrients. Beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to sprout and become a living food. Our exclusive sprouting process not only significantly increases vitamins but also causes a natural change that allows the protein and carbohydrates to be assimilated by the body more efficiently. And even better still, our exclusive baking process preserves these valuable nutrients and retains the important natural fiber and bran. You can see, taste, and smell The Live Grain Difference of Food For Life breads. As nutritious as they are delicious, Food For Life breads are the substance of a meal - not just something that holds a sandwich together. See the difference fresh sprouts really make. So when you're looking for nutrition in bread, reach for the sprouted grain breads from Food For Life and partake of the miracle. Your body and taste buds will know the difference! BioChecked.
