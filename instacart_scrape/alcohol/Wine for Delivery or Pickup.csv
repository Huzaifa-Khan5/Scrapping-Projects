During the fermentation process, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled.

The Riboli family uses this technique to capture the fresh flavors of ripe raspberry, wild strawberry, and red plum. During fermentation, the alcohol is created in tandem with the wine’s natural carbonation. Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. It is not cloying or heavy.

By keeping the juice in contact with the grapes’ red skins for approximately three hours, a light blush color was retained.

Once the desired sweetness is achieved, the wine is centrifuged and bottled. Its natural acidity and low pH strike the perfect balance with the wine’s inherent sweetness. It is not cloying or heavy.
