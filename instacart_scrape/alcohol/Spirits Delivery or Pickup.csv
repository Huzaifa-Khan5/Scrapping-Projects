A true classic, the Jägermeister secret recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1934 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 botanicals of herbs, roots, fruits, and spices sourced from all over the world for a complex flavor profile. The herbs and spices are blended together then steeped in water and alcohol to extract flavors before resting in oak barrels for nearly a year. The base is then mixed with water, caramelized sugar and alcohol before being bottled. Before this herbal liqueur reaches your glass, Jägermeister undergoes 383 quality checks from start to finish. Jägermeister’s flavor consists of five distinct notes, sweet, bitter, citrus, spicy, and aromatic, working together to create a balanced cordial that is unlike anything else. Initial tasting notes of anise, fennel, coffee, orange, burnt sugar and cola come to the forefront with a smooth, complex finish that is not overly sweet. Originally a celebratory drink for hunters, it's the ideal drink to mark any special occasion. Celebrate big wins, birthdays and milestone moments or kick off a well-deserved weekend with this iconic liqueur. The best way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, served straight from the freezer. Jägermeister also brings complex flavor to a variety of classic cocktails.

This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 botanicals of herbs, roots, fruits, and spices sourced from all over the world for a complex flavor profile. The herbs and spices are blended together then steeped in water and alcohol to extract flavors before resting in oak barrels for nearly a year. The base is then mixed with water, caramelized sugar and alcohol before being bottled. Before this herbal liqueur reaches your glass, Jägermeister undergoes 383 quality checks from start to finish. Jägermeister’s flavor consists of five distinct notes, sweet, bitter, citrus, spicy, and aromatic, working together to create a balanced cordial that is unlike anything else. Initial tasting notes of anise, fennel, coffee, orange, burnt sugar and cola come to the forefront with a smooth, complex finish that is not overly sweet. Originally a celebratory drink for hunters, it's the ideal drink to mark any special occasion. Celebrate big wins, birthdays and milestone moments or kick off a well-deserved weekend with this iconic liqueur. The best way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, served straight from the freezer. Jägermeister also brings complex flavor to a variety of classic cocktails. Embrace originality and try a Jägermeister Mule, Jägermeister Old Fashioned or Jägermeister and Tonic for delicious mixed drinks. Jägermeister has 35% ABV and should be enjoyed responsibly.

A true classic, the Jägermeister secret recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1934 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 botanicals of herbs, roots, fruits, and spices sourced from all over the world for a complex flavor profile. The herbs and spices are blended together then steeped in water and alcohol to extract flavors before resting in oak barrels for nearly a year. The base is then mixed with water, caramelized sugar and alcohol before being bottled. Before this herbal liqueur reaches your glass, Jägermeister undergoes 383 quality checks from start to finish. Jägermeister’s flavor consists of five distinct notes, sweet, bitter, citrus, spicy, and aromatic, working together to create a balanced cordial that is unlike anything else. Initial tasting notes of anise, fennel, coffee, orange, burnt sugar and cola come to the forefront with a smooth, complex finish that is not overly sweet. Originally a celebratory drink for hunters, it's the ideal drink to mark any special occasion. Celebrate big wins, birthdays and milestone moments or kick off a well-deserved weekend with this iconic liqueur. The best way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, served straight from the freezer. Jägermeister also brings complex flavor to a variety of classic cocktails. Embrace originality and try a Jägermeister Mule, Jägermeister Old Fashioned or Jägermeister and Tonic for delicious mixed drinks. Jägermeister has 35% ABV and should be enjoyed responsibly.
