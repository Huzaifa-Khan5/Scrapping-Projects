Polar Seltzer Premium Sparkling Water. Tiny Bubbles: The sparkle sets us apart. We've been perfecting the process of making our signature bubbles, with their long-lasting carbonation and crispness, since 1882. The bubbles are created by carefully dissolving Co2 into water at high pressure and freezing temperatures without exposing the flavors to oxygen. Other people may add sodium or sweeteners to shortcut the road to quality – we do not. Natural Flavors: The taste of our seltzers is defined by the quality ingredients of the ingredients we used. Our approach is to use only the highest-quality, proprietary combinations of flavors and aromas for depth and complexity. These ingredients are extracted and distilled from natural sources (such as lemon peel, lime, mint, etc.) to create highly concentrated “essences”. Relying on copious amounts of these very precious oils, we never skimp when it comes to taste. Triple-Filtered & Locally Sourced Water: Our water is locally sourced and then triple-filtered with our state-of-the-art process to ensure a consistent and authentic Polar Seltzer taste. NO sodium, fluoride, or other funny business added. This is why Polar Seltzer makes for health smart hydration. Family Made Since 1882: Just water, zillions of tiny bubbles, and great taste. Our family has been crafting Polar Seltzer with these same ingredients since 1882. That’s 138 years to perfect what our great-great-grandfather called the world’s best-tasting bubble recipe.

Sweet and tart are always right. Polar Seltzer Premium Sparkling Water. Tiny Bubbles: The sparkle sets us apart. We've been perfecting the process of making our signature bubbles, with their long-lasting carbonation and crispness, since 1882. The bubbles are created by carefully dissolving Co2 into water at high pressure and freezing temperatures without exposing the flavors to oxygen. Other people may add sodium or sweeteners to shortcut the road to quality – we do not. Natural Flavors: The taste of our seltzers is defined by the quality ingredients of the ingredients we used. Our approach is to use only the highest-quality, proprietary combinations of flavors and aromas for depth and complexity. These ingredients are extracted and distilled from natural sources (such as lemon peel, lime, mint, etc.) to create highly concentrated “essences”. Relying on copious amounts of these very precious oils, we never skimp when it comes to taste. Triple-Filtered & Locally Sourced Water: Our water is locally sourced and then triple-filtered with our state-of-the-art process to ensure a consistent and authentic Polar Seltzer taste. NO sodium, fluoride, or other funny business added. This is why Polar Seltzer makes for health smart hydration. Family Made Since 1882: Just water, zillions of tiny bubbles, and great taste.

A disease so strange that no doctors of her father, Moctezuma I Ilhuicamina, successor in 1440 of the King Itzcoatl, had been able to cure.,Desperate, the King turned to the older priests in the kingdom to find a cure for his beautiful daughter. They told him that according to the timeless stories of travelers, in a far away northern land, there were strange and hidden waters which flowed at high temperatures. Waters in which one only needed to bathe in or drink from to regain vigor, joy, strength, and refreshment.,Encouraged by this news, Moctezuma I ordered an immediate expedition to take his daughter to this amazing place. After traveling long and rugged roads, the Princess and her expedition reached a fertile valley flanked by mountains. To the east, they saw a mountain with the form of woman’s face (now Cerro de la Silla) and a mole-shaped hill, from whose slopes flowed the prodigal waters.,After spending some time there, taking baths and drinking from the water, the daughter of Moctezuma I, his priests, and chiefs returned to the Anahuac lands optimistic, strong, happy, and refreshed.

Tiny Bubbles: The sparkle sets us apart. We've been perfecting the process of making our signature bubbles, with their long-lasting carbonation and crispness, since 1882. The bubbles are created by carefully dissolving Co2 into water at high pressure and freezing temperatures without exposing the flavors to oxygen. Other people may add sodium or sweeteners to shortcut the road to quality – we do not. Natural Flavors: The taste of our seltzers is defined by the quality ingredients of the ingredients we used. Our approach is to use only the highest-quality, proprietary combinations of flavors and aromas for depth and complexity. These ingredients are extracted and distilled from natural sources (such as lemon peel, lime, mint, etc.) to create highly concentrated “essences”. Relying on copious amounts of these very precious oils, we never skimp when it comes to taste. Triple-Filtered & Locally Sourced Water: Our water is locally sourced and then triple-filtered with our state-of-the-art process to ensure a consistent and authentic Polar Seltzer taste. NO sodium, fluoride, or other funny business added. This is why Polar Seltzer makes for health-smart hydration. Family Made Since 1882: Just water, zillions of tiny bubbles, and great taste. Our family has been crafting Polar Seltzer with these same ingredients since 1882. That’s 138 years to perfect what our great-great-grandfather called the world’s best-tasting bubble recipe. At Polar Beverages we work hard to keep things uncomplicated, refreshing and endlessly creative.

A disease so strange that no doctors of her father, Moctezuma I Ilhuicamina, successor in 1440 of the King Itzcoatl, had been able to cure.,Desperate, the King turned to the older priests in the kingdom to find a cure for his beautiful daughter. They told him that according to the timeless stories of travelers, in a far away northern land, there were strange and hidden waters which flowed at high temperatures. Waters in which one only needed to bathe in or drink from to regain vigor, joy, strength, and refreshment.,Encouraged by this news, Moctezuma I ordered an immediate expedition to take his daughter to this amazing place. After traveling long and rugged roads, the Princess and her expedition reached a fertile valley flanked by mountains. To the east, they saw a mountain with the form of woman’s face (now Cerro de la Silla) and a mole-shaped hill, from whose slopes flowed the prodigal waters.,After spending some time there, taking baths and drinking from the water, the daughter of Moctezuma I, his priests, and chiefs returned to the Anahuac lands optimistic, strong, happy, and refreshed.

A disease so strange that no doctors of her father, Moctezuma I Ilhuicamina, successor in 1440 of the King Itzcoatl, had been able to cure.,Desperate, the King turned to the older priests in the kingdom to find a cure for his beautiful daughter. They told him that according to the timeless stories of travelers, in a far away northern land, there were strange and hidden waters which flowed at high temperatures. Waters in which one only needed to bathe in or drink from to regain vigor, joy, strength, and refreshment.,Encouraged by this news, Moctezuma I ordered an immediate expedition to take his daughter to this amazing place. After traveling long and rugged roads, the Princess and her expedition reached a fertile valley flanked by mountains. To the east, they saw a mountain with the form of woman’s face (now Cerro de la Silla) and a mole-shaped hill, from whose slopes flowed the prodigal waters.,After spending some time there, taking baths and drinking from the water, the daughter of Moctezuma I, his priests, and chiefs returned to the Anahuac lands optimistic, strong, happy, and refreshed. The news about the Princess's recovery spread throughout the kingdom and has passed from generation to generation up until modern times.,Anyone who has tasted a cold Topo Chico sparkling mineral water on a warm day can believe the story of such spectacular refreshment.,• Topo chico sparkling mineral water has been bottled at the source in monterrey, mexico, since 1985,• Refreshing and versatile, it satisfies your thirst or serves as the perfect mixer,• Topo chico’s natural mineral composition is great for quenching thirst,• Topo chico is a zero calorie carbonated beverage,• 4 pack, 12 fl oz glass bottles of topo chico sparkling mineral water","Mineral Water, Carbon Dioxide",{},"Handle with care, product has high carbonation.",,,,,

Polar Seltzer Premium Sparkling Water. Tiny Bubbles: The sparkle sets us apart. We've been perfecting the process of making our signature bubbles, with their long-lasting carbonation and crispness, since 1882. The bubbles are created by carefully dissolving Co2 into water at high pressure and freezing temperatures without exposing the flavors to oxygen. Other people may add sodium or sweeteners to shortcut the road to quality – we do not. Natural Flavors: The taste of our seltzers is defined by the quality ingredients of the ingredients we used. Our approach is to use only the highest-quality, proprietary combinations of flavors and aromas for depth and complexity. These ingredients are extracted and distilled from natural sources (such as lemon peel, lime, mint, etc.) to create highly concentrated “essences”. Relying on copious amounts of these very precious oils, we never skimp when it comes to taste. Triple-Filtered & Locally Sourced Water: Our water is locally sourced and then triple-filtered with our state-of-the-art process to ensure a consistent and authentic Polar Seltzer taste. NO sodium, fluoride, or other funny business added. This is why Polar Seltzer makes for health smart hydration. Family Made Since 1882: Just water, zillions of tiny bubbles, and great taste. Our family has been crafting Polar Seltzer with these same ingredients since 1882. That’s 138 years to perfect what our great-great-grandfather called the world’s best-tasting bubble recipe. At Polar Beverages we work hard to keep things uncomplicated, refreshing and endlessly creative. Take a sip, and let us know.","Carbonated Water, Natural Flavors",{},,Gluten Free,,,,
