Words of enlightenment - Embrace our differences, they are what make the world such an interesting place. - Deborah Dugally, Lover of Horses and Dogs, Sacramento, CA. What is Kombucha? Kombucha is a fermented tea crafted with a living culture (known as a Scoby) added to a base of sweetened tea. The Scoby consumes sugars and caffeine, transforming the tea into this revitalizing wellness drink known in ancient Asian cultures as the tea of immortality. Real, authentic Kombucha, like GT's, is raw and living, offers a tangy taste, natural effervescence, and visible culture strands. Always cultured, never compromised: The bottle in your hand bears my name as a symbol of promise. You have my word: GT's Kombucha is the most authentic Kombucha you can buy. With respect for centuries of Eastern tradition, and using heirloom living cultures passed down by my family, this sacred offering is lovingly handcrafted with goodness you can see, taste, and feel - just as nature intended. - GT Dave, Founder.","Gt's Kombucha* (kombucha Culture*, Black Tea*, Green Tea*, Kiwi Juice*), Pineapple Juice*, Lemon Juice*, Sage*, And 100% Pure Love!!!, *organically Produced","Do not shake.

Her experience inspired my purpose: to introduce this sacred brew to the US in its purest, most potent for for all those seeking better health. Over two decades later, my mission remains stronger than ever to offer the best Kombucha you can find. - GT Dave, Founder. What is Kombucha? Once known as The Tea of Immortality is a fermented drink with origins dating back to 221 BC. This ancient elixir is traditionally and crafted with a sweetened tea base and a like Kombucha culture (Scoby). During fermentation, the Scoby transforms the tea into a bright, tangy, and naturally effervescent beverage with billions of living probiotics to support digestive and immune health. Celebrating 25 years of authentic kombucha. History of Passionberry Bliss: Born: 2007. GT loved passionfruit and nutrition-rich blackberry but couldn't find them in many drinks at the time, so he crafted this flavor to make the exotic more accessible.

Her experience inspired my purpose: to introduce this sacred brew to the US in its purest, most potent form for all those seeking better health. Over two decades later, my mission remains stronger than ever to offer the best Kombucha you can find. - GT Dave, Founder. What is kombucha? Once known as the tea of immortality, kombucha is a fermented drink with origins dating back to 221 B.C. This ancient elixir is traditionally crafted with a sweetened tea base and a live kombucha culture (Scoby). During fermentation, the Scoby transforms the tea into a bright, tangy, and naturally effervescent beverage with billions of living probiotics to support digestive and immune health. Celebrating 25 years of authentic kombucha. History of Heart Beet: Born: 2016.
