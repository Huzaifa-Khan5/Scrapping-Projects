It's common knowledge that consuming foods that contain large amounts of sugar may cause your blood sugar to spike. But did you know other types of carbohydrates may have the same effect on blood sugar? At Atkins, we call this the Hidden sugar effect.

An Atkins Chocolate Shake has the same impact as 1 teaspoon of sugar (Based on glycemic load. Amounts do not represent sugar content). Counting net carbs?
