Lakanto Monk Fruit Sweetener is zero calorie, zero glycemic sweetener that is just like sugar. Over a thousand years ago - In the remote mountain highlands of Asia, a group of Buddhist monks called the Louhan achieved enlightenment and ascension through meditation and pure living. The monks discovered a rare superfood prized for its sweetness and its ability to raise chi, or life energy. This sacred fruit was named monk fruit and was used for centuries to increase chi and well being, earning it the nickname ""The Immortals' Fruit.""
