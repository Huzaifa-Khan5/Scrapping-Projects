In our quest for the perfect tonic water, we spent days in the British Library researching quinine sources before traveling to some of the most remote parts of the world, venturing as far as the Democratic Republic of the Congo to find quinine of the highest quality. Quinine is the vital ingredient in any tonic water but it's the purity of ours that gives Fever-Tree its unique taste.
